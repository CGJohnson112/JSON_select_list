# JSON_select_list
Select option list that controls the view of data from JSON using map, and sort options with JavaScript

Similar to what you might find on many e-commerce sites to filter data from high-low, best price, alphabetical order, etc.
Index is a PHP document, so you will need a server to run it. It can also be changed to an HTML document and will work if you have 
the CORS feature on your Google browser or something similar on a different one. 

*****Still working on getting the list to clear for new data after new option selected: still displays previous data from each successive query in the browser
